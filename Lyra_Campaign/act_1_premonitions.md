## The Journey Begins

In a typical summer day, ***Nick Valentine***, ***Shirley*** and ***Strax*** find themselves relaxing in their office located at Dhumnore's downtown, when ***Janine***, ***Valentine's Investigations'*** receptionist, knocks at the door to deliver two letters. One of the letters has the seal of ***The Merchants Union***, while the remainder doesn't have anything written on it. After opening the latter, the party finds out the letter was sent by ***Al'gaz***, a very influential information broker and arms dealer. He politely requests for an audience on his residence. The party decides to meet with the merchants guild in the morning and with Al'gaz mid-afternoon.

Around the same time, ***Jack Harker*** receives visits on his humble quarters. Two heavily armoured guards knock at his door and ask him to accompany them for an audience with his dear friend ***Anahel***, Dhumnore's mayor. Jack, as usual, is led inconspicuously to Anahel presence, where she reveals to Jack that she received information from Tarnak's intel that the ***Red Patrons*** criminal organisation was attempting to establish contacts with Gilmoira, the city of gnomes located at Fyrn Mountains and main source of Tarnak's gunpowder. She asks Jack to find out what the Red Patrons are scheming.

At this point, Jack heads to Valentine's Investigations' office to discuss this urgent matter, and the party decides to bring Jack along to their audiences in pursuit for all the extra information they can possible gather.

At the merchants guild, the party meets ***Lucio Turpin***, the president of the guild, which, after a cordial negotiation, hires them to find out who's behind the random attacks on the merchant wagons coming from Tarnak. They are to be paid 200gp if they conclude the deal. They also obtain a list of all the survivors' names and addresses.

The party, with some time to kill until Al'gaz audience, decides to speak with one of these survivors. When they knock at the merchant's door, they are welcomed by a lady. She recognises Jack and politely points to him that ***Mr. Smith*** is resting. Jack insists they must urgently discuss some important matters with Mr. Smith, to which his wife ***Marigold*** concedes. From Mr. Smith's chat, the party finds out the attackers don't seem to have a defined modus operandi, and don't seem interested on the cargo.

Afterwards, the party finally heads to Al'gaz's residence in the shadier quarters of Dhumnore. Jack warns the party that Al'gaz is always accompanied with a lady, an I'ludere faeduirn such as Nick, that occasionally intrudes the visitors minds  probing for information or lies. Consistent with Pr'tor views on any chaos portrayal, Shirley decides to wait outside. The remaining party members venture inside and are eventually led to a dim room, with no chairs other than the one Al'gaz is sitting on.

Al'gaz and Jack, two of the most influential individuals in town, are well acquainted and exchange various pieces of information. The party finds out Al'gaz was hired to locate an artefact that resembles a stone hourglass containing a black grainy substance. Al'gaz tries to hire the party, but Jack trades their share of the deal, 1000gp, for extra information, and is told that a few mercenaries from ***The Drama Killers*** approached Al'gaz looking to buy some weaponry. During this exchange of information, the faeduirn opens a communication link with Nick to ask why he is bunching with such losers. She also seems to hint she has her own interests on her partnership with Al'gaz. Al'gaz appears unaware of this exchange, and also appears to have a similar reaction when she attempts to read the mind of the party members in the room.

After the audience, the party heads to the mercenaries guild to meet ***Alan***, the guild master. From him, the party finds out that it is common practice among the mercenaries to engage on unofficial contracts. The guild knows about this but closes their eyes to this practice, and asks for discretion on the matter. In exchange, Alan lets the party know some of the mercenaries who engage on this practice, and that the mercenaries usually hang out in the ***T4U*** tavern when off duty.

When in the tavern, Shirley engages in an arm wrestling contest with a fellow Pr'tor fighter, but is bested by him. Shirley and Jack lose 20gp in total. Jack manages to recover his share by betting and providing some magical assistant to a Taxiarchae mercenary that challenges and beats the Pr'tor.

Meanwhile, Strax approaches three undisturbed mercenaries that are drinking together, unaware that in truthiness they don't know each other. After engaging on a nostalgic conversation with a fellow Eipeks, Strax notices one of the human mercenaries appears to be unsettled. Shirley eventually engages on a conversation with the other human to find out that the unsettled mercenary about to leave just recently joined the guild. He decides to follow him, followed closely by Nick after being alerted to the these occurrences by Jack. Shirley confronts the retreating mercenary, persuading him he belongs to the mercenaries guild, and is looking for a good paying job. The mercenary relaxes his stance and tells Shirley to show up next morning at ***Walwich Wood*** to find out more about the job. When the mercenary is leaving, Shirley, in a moment of misjudgement, asks for the mercenary's name, to which he gets a cold and suspicious answer, "We have no names". It is fairly known mercenaries adopt and address themselves via codenames. Nevertheless, the party decides the best approach is for Shirley to meet the mercenaries next morning in an attempt to join the band, while Strax and Nick are to stay a bit behind and act as backup in case the plan goes awry. Jack decides he will stay in town to gather more intel from his peers.

Next morning, the party rolls out their plan, but it goes awry and Shirley sees himself trapped in a dire situation. While surrendering seems the plausible option, Shirley is a Pr'tor and fighting to death is on his blood.

## The Walwich Ambush

While Shirley, Nick and Strax are about to jump into a trap, Jack heads to ***Dhumnore Angels*** in search of information about the Red Patrons and the mysterious artefact. He meets Archon, a long acquaintance of Anahel, and leader of the Dhumnore Angels, a sort of business rivals of Valentine's Investigations. During the talks, Jack mentions their Walwich operation, to which Archon becomes appalled. He asks an assistant to join them in the room and orders him to dispatch all the available men to Walwich Wood immediately. Before Jack leaving and joining the squadron, Archon makes sure to mention that Jack will owe him one for this.

While at the mercenaries camp, Shirley is confronted with the same old face from previous evening. Along the mercenary, there is another individual wearing a long red robe and carrying a rod. The mercenary says to Shirley that he is surprised he was too stupid to show up, and at this point Shirley is stroke by an arrow coming from the trees. Strax and Nick, hear the roar of pain from Shirley at a distance, but when about to react, they are also hit by concealed shots. After a one sided fight, all Shirley, Strax and Nick surrender and are captured by the mercenaries. While incarcerated, Nick is able to eavesdrop a conversation between both the mercenaries that welcomed Shirley. The ringleader wishes to kill the party members and dispose of the bodies as soon as possible, while the spellcaster appears to ask for prudence, and suggests taking them to the hideout on ***Fyrn Mountains*** before deciding their fates.

A few minutes later, the sound of hooves arise all around the camp, forcing the mercenaries into disarray. Amongst the commotion, the spellcaster hits the ringleader on the back with a spell, rendering him unconscious. The Angels arrest the mercenaries and take them to Dhumnore's palace for interrogation. The party members are released and joined by Jack. The latter goes to ***Mathias***, the spellcaster, to thank him for the help. Mathias is clearly upset because his operation is ruined and appears to hold a grudge towards the Valentine's Investigations members.
Mathias has infiltrated the mercenaries group in an attempt to discover who they worked for.

Now in the palace, Jack, Archon and Nick are charged of conducting the investigations. They are led to a home with only a single mercenary, the apparent ringleader. The mercenary doesn't seem interested on collaborating with the proceedings until Archon mutters a few words and appears to cast a charming spell. From this point, the party learns that the mercenaries were hired by someone unbeknownst to them, but after some investigations of their own, they managed to narrow it down to three council members. ***Aaron Mazi***, a believed gambler responsible for the staff's payrolls, ***Marthil Yinnan***, a recent council member, responsible for guilds regulations, and lastly ***Rowan Fay***, a well-known diplomat. They also learn the mercenary is called ***Filip*** and his codename is ***Swashbuckler***.

The party is given four documents with Anahel seals, allowing them to move unhindered on any council facilities, but still she asks for low profile.

Meanwhile, Strax and Shirley head to T4U for a drink, and afterwards decide to get the contract payment from The Merchants Union, which they do after a clumsy negotiation.

Back on Valentine's Investigations office, Jack is visited by a peer of his, bringing news that Al'gaz is willing to exchange information. Jack and Nick decide to head to Al'gaz residence to discuss the terms, but nothing comes out of it, as both Jack and Al'gaz are unwilling to compromise. Nick also gets to exchange a cryptic conversation with the lady faeduirn acquainted with Al'gaz, and is advised to stay out of it, that things can get dangerous to him and his friends.

Back to their quarters the party decides on the next plan of action. Nick decides to look for information about the artefact on the libraries, Shirley and Strax are to follow one of the council members, and Jack will attempt to contact his peers to obtain more information about the council members.

On the library, Nick finds nothing about the mysterious artefact, but he is able to extract from the resident librarian some locations and people that may be of help.

Strax starts a protest in front of the ***Council House*** while Shirley looks for strange reactions. Nothing seems to happen until a short human pulls is coat lapels up and tries to move away inconspicuously. Shirley sneaks from behind and eventually bumps on the terrified man, stealing a pair of die from his pocket in the process. Realising this could be Aaron Mazi, Shirley and Strax decide to follow him to the ***Gambler's Hut***, a tavern on the shadiest quarters of the city. Shirley goes and offers him a drink while Aaron is playing cards, but Aaron requests 5gp instead. Shirley accedes to this, adding in the beer as an extra, where he drops a pill given to him by Jack. After drinking the beer, Aaron starts acting weirdly, his speech totally incoherent. This raises some suspicions in the room, but Shirley and Strax quickly drag him outside to a dark alley. Here Shirley strips the man of all his possessions, including his clothes, finding a key, a deck of cards, a handkerchief, and his ID. Moreover, they drop him unconscious and head back to the Valentine's Investigations office.

When back together, the party decides to visit Aarons house to try the key they found. The house is located on the nobles quarters. When they are about to try the key, they realise it's not a match, however the door is unlocked. Inside, the house seems deserted and dusty, as if no one was inhabiting it anymore. After a thorough investigation, the party finds a few letters, including debt collectors, threats and blackmailing. From here it is obvious they must pay a visit to the council members offices.

When in the Council House, the party decides to pay a visit to Aaron's office first. This seems to be the place where Aaron has been spending his nights, most likely due to its safety. Here they find more letters similar to the ones found in his house. Marthil's office is near Aaron's so the party decides to move onto this next. When in the office, the party realises the office is featureless, almost as if it didn't belong to a council member. Strax identifies a familiar scent, but he can't put a finger to where he smell it previously. Jack detects some faint traces of magic in the room.

Lastly, the party heads to the second floor to check on Rowan's office. Nick cautiously checks if the door is trapped, and is dextrously able to disable a trap on the door knob. Inside the office, Nick is able to spot an additional trap on a desk drawer, which appeared to be set to burn the contents of it. The drawer has a bunch of paperwork, mostly related to Rowan's diplomat job, however a not strikes to attention. The note specifies a meeting with ***Paeris*** at 11pm of the following day in an alley leading to ***Cardinal Square***.

Before leaving the Council House, Jack leaves a note with a guard relaying this information to Anahel.

At this point, deep into the night, the party decides to give it a rest for today. The night goes uneventful except for Jack. While sound asleep, he finds himself in a ruined and stormy city, facing what looks like a massive portal. Next to the portal, the hourglass artefact floats freely as if luring him to handle it. Jack slowly approaches it and holds it on his hand, feeling this energy tempting him to advance towards the portal. As he starts moving towards the portal, Jack wakes up sweating and panting.
